# NICO editor

This project is made by following this guide: https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html.

I wanted to start this project to get a deeper understanding of the C language, and to create a text-editor that suits my preferences. Hopefully, i will continue to develop the editor in the future.

## TODOs:
* **Clear the terminal**

## Possible future development
* **Add comments**: The source code is currently poorly documented. Will add comments in the near future.

* **Separate code**: Instead of having the source code in one big file, split this file up into different files to make the code more readable and maintainable.

* **More filetypes**: Add syntax highlighting rules for several languages.

* **Line numbers**: Display line numbers on the left hand side.

* **Auto indent**: When starting a new line, indent it to the same level as the previous.

* **Wrap lines**: Insert a newline in the text if the user is about to type past the end of the screen. Divide where it would not split up a word.

* **Copy and paste**: Let the user select text and copy with ```Ctrl-C``` and then paste with ```Ctrl-V```.

* **Config file**: Have the editor read a config file, and let the user configure this to their own needs. Much like the ```.vimrc```-file.
